This was part of my final year project in which I was looking into the accuracy of a Case-Based Reasoning(CBR) Fuzzy-Logic hybrid (Fuzzy-CBR) that I developed. 

# Software and Data Sets

## [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/)
Apart of the Apache Software Foundation, this will enable you to use an excel document as a personal database. POI 4.1.2 was used during development.
